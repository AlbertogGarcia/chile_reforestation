# Abstract {-}

Widespread landscape restoration has become an important part of global efforts to address the intertwined challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, and rural poverty. Payments for ecosystem services are popular, and policymakers often target priority groups in an effort to achieve dual objectives of increased forest cover and social development. This approach has proven to create tradeoffs in payments for avoided deforestation, however, limited evidence exists on its viability in the restoration context. We evaluate the land cover impacts and targeting strategy of a Chilean federal program that pays landowners to restore their property with native species and prioritizes engagement of rural smallholders and indigenous communities. While program compliance was only 31.8\%, we find positive tree cover impacts amongst compliant properties. Although prioritized social characteristics were negatively associated with compliance, administrators verified project completion, preventing nearly \$30 million USD in unconditional cash transfers. In contrast to many studies on avoided deforestation, complying smallholders in high poverty comunas generated the greatest tree cover gains per enrolled hectare. These findings illustrate key opportunities and challenges in targeting for social development in payments for restoration versus avoided deforestation.

# Introduction

In order to achieve the warming targets set by the IPCC, both emissions reductions and removals of carbon from the atmosphere will be necessary [@bastin_global_2019]. Restoration has been lauded as a potentially near term, large scale and low-cost option to achieve these carbon removals [@busch_potential_2019]. Global initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge, Trillion Trees Campaign, and UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration highlight the enthusiasm for restoration and reforestation as a climate solution, however, there is limited evidence documenting the effectiveness of policies seeking to encourage restoration at large scales. Payments for ecosystem services (PES), which pay private landowners in exchange for providing environmental benefits, have been used extensively in the context of avoided deforestation [@borner_effectiveness_2017], and are likely to play a major role as countries begin to scale up restoration in line with global commitments [@gichuki_reviving_2019]. 

Political processes often lead policymakers to design programs aimed at multiple objectives [@tinbergen]. PES programs are no different and are frequently designed to achieve social development goals in addition to environmental gains [@zilberman2008; @lipper2009]. This is done by targeting payments toward landowners or communities with the greatest need for poverty alleviation [@wunder_payments_2008]. However, subsidies that reflect political processes have the potential to undermine environmental benefits [@jack2008], and this strategy has proven to create significant tradeoffs in many payments for avoided deforestation programs [@alix-garcia_payment_2014]. 

It is well documented that poverty is associated with lower levels of deforestation [@busch2017]. Since these households are less likely to deforest in the absence of payments, their participation in PES schemes generates relatively little additional forest cover relative to the no-payment scenario [@pfaff1999]. For example, @cisneros_bolsa_2022 show that Brazil's Bolsa Floresta targeted payments toward areas where deforestation was already low, reducing the avoided deforestation achieved by the program. In another study, @alix-garcia_only_2015 find that the landowners for which PES most effectively reduced poverty provided the smallest avoided deforestation. Further, credit constrained and low-income landowners may be more prone to leakage, meaning that they deforest unenrolled land upon enrolling part of the property [@jack_leakage_2017]. @alix-garcia_leakage_2012 show this to be the case in Mexico's National PES program, where high-poverty communities suffered from leakage, reducing program benefits in those areas.  

While evidence detailing the pitfalls of targeting for "win-wins" in payments for avoided deforestation is widespread, there is a need for rigorous evidence in the restoration setting. Private information about the costs to providing forest often make targeting difficult [@jack_private_2013], and the underlying correlation between targeted characteristics and costs of producing forest may be different in the deforestation and restoration cases. For example, relatively poor households may be unlikely to deforest in the absence of payments, but it may also be costly for them to restore (i.e., produce new forest) without payments. In this scenario, it is relatively more costly for prioritized groups to provide forest in the restoration case, but less costly in the avoided deforestation case. Second, non-compliance often plays a major role in the restoration context. Landowners may enroll in a PES program but fail to complete contracted activities if, for example, landowners are uncertain about restoration costs and benefits [@oliva_technology_2020]. If targeted characteristics are positively correlated with non-compliance, tension may arise between participation of priority groups and program effectiveness.

In this paper, we use novel data to quantify the land cover impacts of Chile’s Native Forest Law, which provided subsidies for native forest restoration and sought co-benefits such as economic development of smallholder, indigenous, and rural communities. We evaluate land cover impacts for ten cohorts (2009–2018) using annual data from 2000–2018. Temporally consistent annual landcover data detailing tree cover and other land classes such as grasslands and croplands allow us a unique opportunity to evaluate restoration outcomes using difference-in-differences approaches. We then evaluate the Native Forest Law's targeting strategy, which prioritized the participation of marginalized landowners. Applications were split into two separate contests based on property size and landowner assets. Applications were then explicitly scored to determine priority. This score is based not only project-specific characteristics, but also social characteristics that have a clear positive association with poverty. 

A key concern with evaluations of programs with voluntary participation is that apparent effectiveness may actually be due to different participation costs [@jack_self_2019]. The typical enrollee to the Native Forest Law competition was already increasing forest cover prior to enrollment in the program. If we were to simply compare enrolled and unenrolled properties after enrollment, we would likely overestimate the effect of the subsidies, since enrollees were producing new forest cover even without payments. In order to alleviate concerns surrounding selection, we use pre-processing techniques to construct a set of control properties from a pool of all rural properties in the major forested regions of Chile. These matched control properties are much more comparable to enrollees than the typical unenrolled property based on a detailed set of land use and property characteristics. These characteristics include pre-program land-uses, which are likely to drive enrollment decisions. Difference-in-differences methods further allow us to control for fixed differences in land cover between enrollees and the control group and time trends affecting both groups. Using this strategy to estimate treatment effects for properties that dropped out after the first six months and never received payment yields no statistically or economically meaningful treatment effect, lending creedence to our estimates for program beneficiaries. 

We find that the program led to small increases in tree cover on the properties of landowners who received payment, coming largely from land that was previously cropland or grassland. A landowner having their entire property subsidized through the Native Forest Law contest led to a .9 \% increase in tree cover on average. Event study estimates based on weaker identification assumptions also suggest that the program led to a 1.44 \% increase in tree cover 9 years post-enrollment for the typical property. These estimates likely represent lower bounds on the program's overall impact, since many enrollees engaged in a non-zero amount of subsidized restoration in already standing native forest, which is unlikely to be reflected in our satellite-derived measures of land cover extent. Further, environmental benefits may be understated if landowners substitute away from plantation forest into native forest, which is not observable in our study. 

Non-compliance in the Native Forest Law was high, as over two-thirds of applicants never received payment. Landowners with higher application social scores did suffer from relatively higher levels of non-compliance, however program administrators avoided unconditional payments by requiring verification of activity completion. While program administrators in the Native Forest Law avoided increased losses, this association may reduce cost-effectiveness in contexts where checking compliance is difficult or costly. We find that smallholders drive the main treatment effect, while larger, wealthier landowners in the other interested party contest provided no positive tree cover benefits at all. Landowners in higher poverty communities were associated with increased tree cover effects, for which the program's scoring rules were a good predictor.  

Our results make several contributions to the literature. First, we add to the limited existing evidence on the environmental effectiveness of large-scale native forest restoration programs. Between 2009 and 2019, the National Forest Corporation (CONAF) allocated approximately US $58 million to enroll more than 235 hectares of land through the Native Forest Law, making it one of the largest native forest restoration programs in the world. There are relatively few studies evaluating payments for forest restoration and even fewer quantifying the impacts of large-scale policies. As other countries begin to contemplate restoration policies, Chile’s experience provides a valuable case study from which to draw.

Our second contribution is to highlight key differences between targeting in payments for reforestation in contrast to avoided deforestation. While targeting for social development has typically come at the cost of environmental gains in payments for avoided deforestation, no study to our knowledge has addressed this question in the restoration setting. First, non-compliance plays a significant role, and cost-effectiveness may suffer if checking compliance is difficult and non-compliance is positively correlated with targeted characteristics. We find that targeted characteristics were associated with non-compliance, however, non-compliers were never paid. In terms of environmental gains conditional on compliance, we identify a potential opportunity for win-wins in the restoration context. Landowners in high-poverty areas actually yielded greater tree cover gains, likely because of their lack of restoration activity without payments. This highlights that the relative costs of providing forest between wealthy and relatively poorer landowners may be reversed in the deforestation and restoration contexts.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on Chile's Native Forest law and its associated contest for restoration grants. In section 3, we outline the data and provide descriptive trends and statistics. We quantify the land cover impacts of the Native Forest Law subsidies in section 4. Section 5 explores whether targeting for social development undermined or enhanced environmental benefits, taking into account non-compliance. Section 6 concludes. 

# Background: Chile's Native Forest Law

Chile’s long history of public policies supporting tree cover expansion provides an incredibly useful setting in which to measure the impacts of payments for restoration. Chile's decree law no. 701 (DL 701) is one of the world's longest operating afforestation subsidies, but mainly promoted even-aged mococulture plantations of eucalyptus and pine that had negative effects on biodiversity and native forest cover [@heilmayr_impacts_2020]. Further, only about 3\% of subsidized plantations were additional. 

In an attempt to encourage the recovery and protection of native forests, Chile sought to pass the Ley de Recuperación del Bosque Nativo y Fomento Forestal (Native Forest Law) as a successor to DL701 [@clapp1998]. Initially expected in 1994, it became frozen in legislature before finally passing in 2008. In addition to protections for native forests, the law established an annual competition for grants to support private landowners in their efforts to manage, restore, or reforest their land using native species. Since 2009, more than \$58 million have been allocated through these competitions for projects covering 235 thousand hectares. Much of this allocated funding has not been paid to landowners, however, as program follow-through is low. 

The subsidy component of the law encourages three types of activities: 1) the regeneration, restoration or protection of native preservation forests; 2) silvicultural activities aimed at restoring native forests for timber production purposes; and 3) silvicultural activities aimed at restoring native forests for non-timber production purposes. Of the 12,889 projects enrolled between 2009 and 2019, 10,912 (84.66\%) restored native forest for the purposes of timber production. Few estimates on the impacts of the Native Forest Law on land cover currently exist. CONAF estimated the carbon impacts of the Native Forest Law through 2018 as it relates to Chile's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as part of the Paris Argeement. These estimates, however, assume that the carbon stored by every eligible subsidized hectare is the direct result of the law. These types of estimates ignore the concept of additionality, since some of this forest would likely exist even in the absence of the law. 

By prioritizing native forest rather than monocultures of pine or eucalyptus, the law seeks to incentivize the preservation of biological diversity. Prioritizing carbon-plantings without consideration of other co-benefits may result in negligible biodiversity co-benefits [@bryan2016]. In fact, DL701 resulted in the decline of native forest and biodiversity, as native forests provide significantly more biodiversity than plantation forests in Chile [@heilmayr_impacts_2020].

In order to receive payment, landowners must clear two key administrative hurdles. Upon having an application selected by the program, landowners must first provide an updated native forest management plan. This management plan details the specific activities to be performed on the property and a timeline for activity completion. Landowners generally have six months from the date of selection to provide the management plan or be dropped from the program. Many landowners drop out at this stage of the program, as only `r round(pct_mgmt_plan*100, digits = 2)`\% of enrollees submit the management plan within the required window. 

The timeframe for activities generally lasts multiple years, and landowners are not eligible to receive payment until a minimum of two years after enrollment. Landowners must also have the project's completion verified by a third party. Conditional on submitting the management plan, the rate of payment is relatively high at `r round(pct_compliers_given_plan * 100, digits = 2)`\%. Ultimately though, only `r round(pct_compliers*100, digits = 2)`\% of projects enrolled between 2009 and 2019 have actually been paid out on. Program administrators have cited both capital constraints and a lack of labor supply as potential causes for such high rates of non-compliance. Submission of the management plan requires submission of the property cartography, which may also deter some landowners who struggle with the administrative hurdle itself. 

The Native Forest Law prioritizes not only forest cover in line with Chile's NDC goal of managing 200,000 ha of native forest, but also the participation of underrepresented groups. It is explicitly mentioned in the Native Forest Law seeks to meet the dual objectives of rural economic development in addition to protection of the environment. In the case of the Native Forest Law subsidy competition, this is done by prioritizing applications of landowners deemed to be of higher social priority. This is done in two main ways: 1) holding separate contests for smallholders and wealthier, larger properties; and 2) a scoring mechanism that gives higher scores to indigenous peoples, smaller properties, and those in rural regions. We further explore the ramifications of this targeting strategy in Section \@ref(targeting). 


# Data and descriptive trends

## Administrative data

We have obtained property boundaries for all rural properties in the major forested regions of Chile as of the year 2009. Data on the awarded properties are available through CONAF and reflect aspects of the property and projects such as project objective, project surface area, bonus amount, and whether a management plan was submitted within six months. Also included is each property's parcel indentifier, which is unique to each property within a comuna, Chile's level 3 administrative unit. We match the enrolled properties to their corresponding boundaries via this unique parcel identifier. In addition, we observe payment recipients, which are matched to the corresponding program application, indicating whether a project was successfully completed.

```

## Satellite data

In order to quantify environmental impacts of the Native Forest Law, we use annual measures of land use and land cover. Our primary outcomes of interest come from annual Landsat (30m) resolution maps of landcover developed in @graesser2022. These maps classify pixels into one of the following classes for each year between 1999-2018: forest, crop, grassland, shrub, and bareground. These land cover maps provide a unique opportunity to examine restoration outcomes. While many studies use satellite derived measures of deforestation to generate annual panels of forest loss, very few studies leverage annual variation in specific land cover types outside of those focused on North America and Europe. Further, the @graesser2022 product was developed specifically to produce more consistent land cover estimates over long time periods and gradual change events, such as restoration. 

<!-- We use the enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2) as a proxy for each property's annual cumulative level of vegetation cover. To generate the outcome for each property, we compute the average maximum EVI value of each pixel within a property for a given year. One benefit of the use of EVI is the ability to capture both new forest cover and changes in forest quality within a single index measure. We prefer EVI to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) because of NDVI's propensity to become saturated in high biomass regions. Given Chile's extensive native and plantation forests and the fact that many enrolled properties already have some degree of existing forest cover, this could limit our ability to detect small changes in the area or density of vegetation through time. In contrast, EVI corrects for canopy background noise and is more sensitive in areas with dense vegetation.  -->

Second, Landsat resolution land-use classification maps of these regions in Chile developed in [@heilmayr_impacts_2020] allow us to distinguish the proportion of each property engaged in specific land uses prior to the existence of the Native Forest Law. Of particular interest is the distinction between plantation forest and native forest, which cannot be disentangled in the @graesser2022 product. In contrast to native forest, high levels of plantation forest may indicate greater ability to manage forest and undertake contracted activities. All of our satellite derived measures of land use cover the extent of the major forested areas of Chile, representing the regions that contain the vast majority of Native Forest Law enrollees. 

## Descriptive trends

Summary statistics for enrolled properties are shown in Table \@ref(tab:main-summary). Most enrollees enroll less than 15\% of their property through the competition. Typical enrollee properties already have quite a significant amount of native forest cover and some plantation forest prior to the existence of the Native Forest Law. 

```{r main-summarystats, results = 'asis'}

main_summarystats <- readRDS("results/main_summarystats.rds")%>%
  dplyr::rename(Statistic = rowname,
         Mean = mean,
         Median = median,
         `Std. Deviation` = sd)

stargazer(main_summarystats, summary = FALSE, rownames = FALSE, header = FALSE,
          title = "Summary statistics for enrollees in Native Forest Law subsidy contest")

```

Figure \@ref(fig:descriptive-trends) shows the average change in tree cover relative to the year 2000 leading up to enrollees' enrollment. We see that the typical enrollee was increasing tree cover on their property prior to their application to the subsidy competition. This broad finding holds across different subsamples of enrollees, however, some groups were increasing tree cover at greater rates prior to enrollment. The left panel shows that those with above median values of $social_i$, the application's social score, were increasing forest cover at a relatively lower rate than those with low social scores. This suggests that socially prioritized landowners were not generating as much new tree cover in the absence of the program. The right panel suggests that smallholders with high social scores, perhaps indicative of the most marginalized landowners, were producing the least new forest cover prior ro enrollment. This may suggest that low-income or indigenous smallholders had relatively higher costs to producing forest cover.

# Program evaluation

To quantify the environmental impacts of the Native Forest Law subsidy contest, we focus on landowners who complied with program requirements and received payment. As is the problem with many PES impact evaluations, enrollment is non-random. Landowners choose to enroll in the program and, in theory, have an opportunity cost equal to or lower than program payment. This means that the average enrollee likely has lower participation costs than the average unenrolled landowner. It is then ill-advised to simply use unenrolled properties as the counterfactual, since unobservable factors affecting enrollment could drive changes in forest cover outcomes, not enrollment. 

## Constructing a counterfactual

In order to move toward a more convincing counterfactual, we first use matching as a pre-processing technique to generate a control group from amongst all unenrolled rural properties in the major forested regions of Chile. This should yield control properties with more similar opportunity costs to enrollees than amongst the general population. This approach is similar to many studies in the literature [e.g., @cisneros_bolsa_2022]. 

The covariates used for matching include environmental and economic characteristics likely to determine enrollment decisions and project performance. We include pre-enrollment property land-use including levels of native forest, plantation forest, and pasture. Landowners with similar levels of plantation forest, native forest, and other land uses on the property should face a similar decision about whether to enroll in a program involving native forest management. Other included covariates give a sense of a property's productive potential, remoteness, and timber market access. We also match on land cover pre-trends to help us to build confidence in the common trends identification assumptions we make in the next section. We exclude the two year trends leading up to the enrollment year in order to avoid concerns of overfitting. Thus, seeing that pre-trends in the pre-trend period prior to enrollment hold should lend further creedence to the matching process. Matches are made with replacement based on nearest neighbor propensity scores from a logit model. Our main strategy matches each program enrollee with two control properties, however, we also include estimates based on mahalanobis distance metrics and matching each enrolled property with one and three nearest neighbors as robustness checks (Appendix \@ref(pre-process)).

Prior to pre-processing, enrolled and unenrolled properties differ significantly. The typical enrollee had significantly less land engaged in pasture or agriculture and significantly more native forest already relative to the typical unenrolled property. Table \@ref(tab:covar-bal)displays balance checks for all covariates used. The normalized mean difference and variance were reduced for nearly every covariate after the matching process. Figure \@ref(fig:m-dist) in the Appendix shows how comparability between selected covariate distributions drastically improved between treatment and control properties after matching. After processing, balance improved on every included covariate, and imbalance was reduced to below the often-used normalized mean difference threshold of 0.25 for every covariate. 

```{r covar-balance, results = 'asis'}

covar_balance_table <- readRDS("results/covar_balance_table.rds")%>%
  mutate_at(2:5, ~round(., digits = 2))

kable(covar_balance_table, format = "latex", row.names = FALSE, booktabs = T, escape = FALSE,
      col.names = c("Covariate", "Unmatched", "Matched", "Unmatched", "Matched"), align='c',
      caption = "Covariate balance before and after matching")%>%
  row_spec(0,bold=TRUE)%>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Norm. mean diff." = 2, "Variance diff." = 2))

```


One concern may be our decision to exclude rejected applicants from the control group. Given that these properties have revealed their intention to enroll in the program, it seems that they may have opportunity costs similar to program enrollees. However, the composition of the rejected applicants differs between smallholders and other interested parties depending on year, and the composition of the rejected applicant group is relatively unstable through time. Further, it would be difficult to make claims about the differences between the smallholders and other interested parties, because the rejected group differs through time and is not comparably balanced for each. We discuss the rejected applicants in more detail in Appendix \@ref(rejected). 

## Main specification

We take advantage of our panel data setting and estimate the following equation to reveal the land cover impacts of the Native Forest Law subsidy contest:

\begin{align}
outcome_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times intensity_{it} + \gamma_i + \lambda_t + X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{align}

where $outcome_{it}$ represents the share of property $i$ engaged in a specific land cover outcome in year $t$; $intensity_{it}$ represents the proportion of property $i$ enrolled through the Native Forest Law subsidy contest in year $t$; and $\gamma_i$ and $\lambda_t$ represent property and year fixed effects, respectively. Property fixed effects ($\gamma_i$) control for unobserved time invariant characteristics such as landowner preferences. Year fixed effects ($\lambda_t$) control for time-varying shocks that are common across all properties such as changes in other environmental policies. Conditional on covariates and fixed effects, $\beta_1$ recovers the impact of enrollment in the Native Forest Law contest, conditional on compliance. 

Because \@ref{main-spec} relies on property and year fixed effects, it falls under the umbrella of two-way fixed effects (TWFE) estimators. This literature has received ample attention in recent years, particularly in the case of binary treatment (i.e., whether a property enrolled) [@roth_trending_2022; @de_chaisemartin_survey_2022]. In this context, binary treatment would ignore the proportion of the property enrolled through the contest. This is of concern, because the median landowner enrolls less than 15\% of their land in the program, with significant variation across properties. 

Importantly, $intensity_{it}$ represents a continuous treatment in the context of TWFE estimation. @callaway_continuous_2021 decompose TWFE estimators when treatment is continuous and show that $\beta_1$ represents the weighted average change in outcomes from incremental changes in land enrollment across and within periods. Thus, my identification relies on the following assumption: properties that enrolled an additional increment of land in the Native Forest Law contest, must experience the same evolution in outcomes as properties that never enrolled the increment. I evaluate the plausibility of this common trends assumption based on both raw trends and an event study in Appendix \@ref(identification).  

## Event study

The dynamics of payments for ecosystem services are important, and perhaps moreso in the restoration context. Tree cover is not established instantaneously, including in satellite-derived measures of tree cover, where a pixel is only classified as tree cover if it is greater than 30\% canopy cover. Survivorship of trees is also key, as many planting initiatives have led to minimal long-term success [@coleman2021]. These factors are echoed in the Native Forest Law payment scheme, where landowners are not even eligible to receive their payment in the first year of enrollment.  

We use the estimator developed in @callaway_did_2021 to generate event study treatment effects. It is important to note that this estimator relies on binary treatment. While this cannot account for the fact that properties enroll only a selected proportion of a property, it provides robustness properties not true of equation (1). First, our event study estimates rely on a relatively weaker conditional common trends assumption, meaning that common trends need only hold after conditioning on our detailed set of time-invariant pre-treatment characteristics. The @callaway_did_2021 estimator is also robust to general treatment effect heterogeneity, which, in severe cases, could flip the sign of our treatment effect estimates [@de_chaisemartin_2020].  

## Program evaluation results

Table 2 shows that using the matched control group, the characteristic enrolled property sees an increase in tree cover after enrollment relative to the counterfactual. It also sees a decline in grassland and cropland. Since $intensity_{it}$ is the proportion of the property enrolled, $\beta_1$ can be interpreted as the impact of enrolling the average landowner's full property through the Native Forest Law competition. For the average property, enrolling the full property leads to a 0.63 percentage point (0.90\%) increase in tree cover extent. However, since the average landowner enrolls 23\% of their land (\@ref(tab:main-summarystats)), the impact for the typical enrollee is closer to a 0.14 (.21\%) percentage point increase in tree cover extent. It also led to a 0.21 (7.14\%) and 0.45 (1.8\%) percentage point decline in the share of the typical enrollees' property with crop and grassland, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the property, the level of the decision-making unit and at which treatment is assigned.

\input{results/twfe_main_table.tex} 

In order to gauge the plausibility of the matched control group as a counterfactual, we consider a similar estimation strategy using program enrollees who never submitted a management plan. These non-compliant properties, although selected to participate, never again engaged administratively with the program after initial selection. They failed to provide a management plan within 6 months of enrollment, and therefore, were dropped from the program. Having dropped within such a short time-frame and never submitted a management plan indicates that these landowners likely never engaged in what would have been subsidized restoration activities. We use the same pre-processing techniques to generate a matched control group for these non-compliers and again estimate equation (1). Table 3 shows that the estimated tree cover treatment effect is not only statistically insignificant, but also of no meaningful magnitude. Although there is a statistically significant effect for crop, the magnitude is very small. It may also be the case that landowners in this group converted crop cover in response to enrollment, but never could commit to establishing tree cover in its place. Finding no meaningful effect amongst properties that engaged with the program but dropped out soon after enrollment lends credence to our main estimation strategy. 

\input{results/twfe_nc_main_table.tex}

Figure \@ref(main-eventstudy) shows event study treatment effects based on the estimator developed in @callaway_did_2021. Similar to results based on equation (1), these estimates indicate that the Native Forest Law subsidies increased tree cover, while reducing crop and grassland. These graphs indicate that most of the increased tree cover seems to have come from grassland conversion. Pre-treatment estimates in Figure \@ref(main-eventstudy) represent pseudo-$ATT$s, which are all indistinguishable from zero across the three land cover types. The conditional common trends assumption on which these estimates rely, therefore, seems plausible. As discussed above, these event study estimates are robust against concerns surrounding general treatment heterogeneity and do not rely on assumptions as stringent as those based on our main specification. Seeing that these results are similar to those from the equation (1) lend confidence to our main specification.

# Targeting for social development {#targeting}

## The Native Forest Law's targeting strategy

In order to qualify for the smallholder contest, landowners must have assets and a property size below a set threshold for each region. The benefits of qualifying for the smallholder contest include 15\% higher payments as well as increased odds of receiving a grant through the contest. While the Native Forest Law used these separate contests to alleviate concerns that large corporations with significant assets would reap the rewards from the program, smallholder classification is still quite broad. In the typical region, properties up to 200 hectares can qualify for the smallholder contest. Figure \@ref(psize) shows that while many applicants in the smallholder contest are truly landowners with small properties, many larger properties are able to enter the smallholder contest.

In addition to holding separate contests, the program used a scoring system in order to assign project funding priority within each contest. Projects were granted funding in descending order of score until the allocated funding had been assigned. This meant that projects sometimes went unfunded because of a low score, although no ex-ante cutoff existed. This was particularly common in the other interested parties contests, which were granted funding after the smallholders. In some years, a second smallholder contest was held, causing smallholders to go unfunded because of low scores. The scoring criteria include factors related both to landowner, property, and project characteristics. This score, although not always critical for smallholder applicants, provides insight to program administrators' preferences for project prioritization. For simplicity, it amounts to a sum of social and project specific characteristics:

$$ score_i = social_i + project_i$$

where $social_i$ represents components of the score deemed to be of social importance by program designers; and $project_i$ represents components of the score representing project specific characteristics unrelated to the landowner themselves. The social component, $social_i$, includes factors such as property size and indigenous status, while $project_i$ includes characteristics related to the land and specific activities carried out. $social_i$ consists of the following components:

- property size (higher scores to smaller properties)
- indigenous status (higher scores to indigenous landowners or communities)
- estimate of labor hours
- the amount of the project (disincentivizing particularly large projects)

This demonstrates the specific social characteristics prioritized by program administrators. While the score does not explicitly target high-poverty landowners, the objective is to promote rural economic development and poverty alleviation. In order to understand whether the social score was a good predictor of poverty alleviation potential, we regress the social score on 2007 comuna level poverty. 

\begin{align} 
ComunaPov_i = \rho_0 + \rho_1 \times social_i + \rho_2 \times project_i + e_i
\end{align}

The results are shown in Table XX and indicate that the

## The relationship between non-compliance and targeting

Targeting payments toward groups that suffer from high levels of non-complance may be costly. This is particularly true in contexts where non-compliance is particularly low, such as the Native Forest Law. Targeting groups that suffer from relatively greater levels of non-compliance may degrade the cost-effectiveness of the program if checking compliance is difficult or costly. 

In order to examine how prioritization of social characteristics in the Native Forest Law scoring system was correlated with compliance, we use regressions of the following form:

$$ complied_i = \psi_0 + \psi_1 social_i + \psi_2 project_i + X_i + u_i $$

where $complied_i$ is a dummy variable equal to 1 if landowner $i$ followed through and received payment for successful project completion. 

Table 4 shows the results of these regressions. Our coefficient of interest in these regressions is $\beta_1$, which captures the association of an increase in $social_i$ on compliance, holding the other parts of the project component constant. We see that higher values of $social_i$ are associated with a decreased probability of compliance, indicating that landowners who were prioritized by the program were less likely to comply. That said, the smallholder contest saw increased levels of compliance on average, relative to the other interested party contest, possibly due to higher payments or greater use of extensionists. Columns (2), (3), and (5) show that extensionists were associated with large increases in compliance probability, perhaps indicating that some of the risk of non-compliance by priority groups can be mitigated. 


\input{results/compliance_targeting.tex}

### Verification saved significant resources

CONAF saved significant resources by not paying landowners who never completed contracted activities. In cases where compliance checks are costly or infeasible, as may be the case in many developing countries, non-compliance may degrade a program's cost-effectiveness. Program administrators may spend resources checking compliance or by paying landowners who never provide environmental benefits. Because Chile is a country with stong institutional capacity, this was avoided in the Native Forest Law.

Landowners were not eligible to receive the payments until after third-party verification of completed activities. For most projects, this verification was not accepted until two years after enrollment, meaning that landowners had to sustain progress for a substantial period of time. This hurdle may have made compliance more difficult for credit constrained individuals. We see suggestive evidence of this through reduced compliance by relatively poorer and socially prioritized landowners. However, these compliance checks prevented payment of \$`r usd_saved_millions` million USD to landowners who never completed their planned forest restoration activities. As seen in Table 3, these projects led to no meaningful tree cover impacts, so compliance checks greatly improved overall cost-effectiveness of the program relative to the case where non-compliers were paid.  

## The relationship between program impact and targeting

To answer the question of whether the Native Forest Law's strategy to target for social development undermined environmental impacts, we consider several variables that correspond to application prioritization and socioeconomic status. We first consider treatment effect heterogeneity based on the contest from which projects were admitted: the smallholder or other interested party contest. Table XX shows that payments through the smallholder contest were more effective than those through the other interested party contest, and further, those from the other interested party contest did not yield any positive impact at all. 

\input{results/twfe_matched_contest_table.tex}

We next consider heterogeneity based on comuna-level poverty. Although poverty was not explicitly used by program administrators to target, higher values of $social_i$ are associated with higher comuna-level poverty (Table XX), and poverty alleviation is generally the primary goal of targeting payments to marginalized groups. We use the following regression to do so:

\begin{align}
treecover_{it} = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \times intensity_{it} + \alpha_2 \times intensity_{it} \times ComunaPov_i + \gamma_i + \lambda_t + X_{it} + e_{it}
\end{align}

where $ComunaPov_i$ represents the 2007 poverty percent from the Comuna in which landowner $i$ resides. Here, $\alpha_2$ represents the parameter of interest, indicating how $ComunaPov_i$ influences the land cover impacts of the Native Forest Law subsidies. We see that projects located in comunas with higher rates of poverty actually yielded higher treatment effects in the smallholder contest. 

\input{results/twfe_matched_cpov_table.tex}

# Discussion and conclusion

Prominent initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge, Trillion Trees Initiative, and UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration hope to address the intertwined challenges of rural poverty, climate change and biodiversity loss through large-scale afforestation and reforestation. Initial national plans indicate that many countries will follow Chile’s earlier model for tree cover expansion, relying heavily upon subsidies and plantation forests to achieve their commitments [@heilmayr_impacts_2020]. In light of the fact that this model may have negative impacts on native forest extent, biodiversity, and other outcomes, payments for native forest restoration may provide a more sustainable and socially beneficial path forward. Further, this may lead to increased additionality if alternative policies simply subsidize plantation forests that would have been planted anyways. Native Forest Law payments led to increased vegetation cover on enrolled properties, indicating that this model may a viable approach to designing payments for reforestation. 

Whether or not program administrators can successfully target priority groups without sacrificing environmental benefits depends on two key factors. First, priority groups that have relatively lower costs of providing forest cover are likely to generate little additional carbon benefits. Second, if priority groups are less likely to complete contracted activities, benefits may be lost to both program administrators and landowners in rural or poor communities. In the context of Chile's Native Forest Law, we find that smallholders, including prioritized landowners in smallholder, rural, and indigenous communities were less likely to comply with the PES contracts. However, this did not undermine program cost-effectiveness, because administrators only paid landowners who were confirmed to have completed projects. In other contexts where checking compliance is difficult, this may be more critical for program effectiveness. These prioritized landowners had greater environmental impacts, indicating that targeting these groups was not detrimental to environmental benefits, as has often been seen in payments for avoided deforestation, but in fact beneficial.

### Beneficiaries vs. non-compliers 

Table \@ref(tab:compliance-covars) shows that landowners who follow-through differ from those who do not on a number of characteristics. This includes project and property characteristics. Notably, projects that do follow-through are likely to belong to properties with more plantation forest, but there is no notable difference in native forest. This perhaps indicates some prior experience managing or planting forests amongst compliers.

## Common trends assumption {#identification}

As mentioned in the main text, for $\beta_1$ from equation (1) to yield the causal effect of the program, we need to rely on a common trends assumption. In order to evaluate the plausibility of common trends in this setting, we examine the raw tree cover trends of the complying enrollees relative to the matched control group. Figure XX shows that the matched group had slightly higher levels of tree cover, but the trends look comparable. The right panel adjusts for 2008 differences in tree cover to better evaluate the pre-trends prior to the implementation of the program in 2009. 

```{r include = FALSE}
rawtrends_trees_compliermatch <- readRDS("results/rawtrends_trees_compliermatch.rds")

TreatTrees08 <- (rawtrends_trees_compliermatch %>% filter(treat ==1 & Year == 2008))$Trees

## Using non-compliers as a control for compliers {#noncomplier-control}

We also explore the use of non-compliant properties as a control for those that did follow through and receive payment. Even in the case where these non-compliant properties do engage in some level of restoration, they do so without any subsidization. This means that while the program may have influenced these landowners to engage in restoration, the payment itself did not drive any additional tree cover for these properties. Table XX indicates that amongst the group that did follow through and receive payment, the program generated positive tree cover impacts, while reducing crop and grassland. Table XX shows that all results examining the association between prioritized characteristics and program impact are consistent with those in the main text.
