	abstract = {Based on observations from all three tropical continents, there is good reason to believe that poor service providers can broadly gain access to payment for environmental services (PES) schemes, and generally become better off from that participation, in both income and non-income terms. However, poverty effects need to be analysed in a conceptual framework looking not only at poor service providers, but also at poor service users and non-participants. Effects on service users are positive if environmental goals are achieved, while those on non-participants can be positive or negative. The various participation ﬁlters of a PES scheme contain both pro-poor and anti-poor selection biases. Quantitative welfare effects are bound to remain small-scale, compared to national poverty-alleviation goals. Some pro-poor interventions are possible, but increasing regulations excessively could curb PES efﬁciency and implementation scale, which could eventually harm the poor. Prime focus of PES should thus remain on the environment, not on poverty.},

	abstract = {A broad empirical literature uses “event study” research designs for treatment eﬀect estimation, a setting in which all units in the panel receive treatment but at random times. We make four novel points about identiﬁcation and estimation of causal eﬀects in this setting and show their practical relevance. First, we show that in the presence of unit and time ﬁxed eﬀects, it is impossible to identify the linear component of the path of pre-trends and dynamic treatment eﬀects. Second, we propose graphical and statistical tests for pre-trends. Third, we consider commonly-used “static” regressions, with a treatment dummy instead of a full set of leads and lags around the treatment event, and we show that OLS does not recover a reasonable weighted average of the treatment eﬀects: long-run eﬀects are weighted negatively, and we introduce diﬀerent estimators robust to this issue. Fourth, we show that equivalent problems of under-identiﬁcation and negative weighting arise in diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences settings when the control group is allowed to be on a diﬀerent time trend or in the presence of unit-speciﬁc time trends.},

In this paper we analyze the environmental impacts of Bolsa Floresta, a forest conservation program that combines direct conditional payments with livelihood-focused investments in 15 multiple-use reserves in the Brazilian state of Amazonas. We use grid-based data, nearest-neighbor matching, and panel data econometrics to compare three forest-related program outcomes – deforestation, degradation, and fires –of participating and non-participating reserve areas. Forest threats were low before and after treatment, because the program prioritized low-pressure sites. Thus, we find significant but small additional conservation effects from the implementation of the program. Notwithstanding, treatment effects are relatively larger in areas with higher deforestation pressure and higher potential agricultural income. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence showing that adverse spatial targeting of conservation incentives, i.e. disproportionally enrolling low–pressure sites, is a prime cause for the low additionality found in rigorous impact evaluations of many existing initiatives.},

There has been a boom in the design of local and international policy instruments to prevent further deforestation and to encourage forest growth. This article reviews the theory and evidence surrounding forest-related payment for ecosystem services (PES) schemes intended to slow and reverse deforestation. We cover the most recent work touching on a range of issues related to PES programs, including research on targeting, contract design, environmental effectiveness, challenges to program implementation, spillovers, and distributional considerations of conditional cash transfers. We also highlight areas of potential future research.},

This highlights global tree restoration as one of the most effective carbon drawdown solutions to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by {\textasciitilde}223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.},

	abstract = {We adopt a theory-based approach to synthesize research on the eﬀectiveness of payments for environmental services in achieving environmental objectives and socio-economic co-beneﬁts in varying contexts. Our theory of change builds on established conceptual models of impact pathways and highlights the role of (1) contextual dimensions (e.g., political, institutional, and socio-economic conditions, spatial heterogeneity in environmental service values and provision costs, and interactions with pre-existing policies), and (2) scheme design (e.g., payment type and level, contract length, targeting, and diﬀerentiation of payments) in determining environmental and socio-economic outcomes. To shed light on the overall eﬀectiveness of payment schemes, and its determinants, we review counterfactual-based empirical evaluations, comparative analyses of case-studies, and meta-analyses. Our review suggests that program eﬀectiveness often lags behind the expectations of early theorists. However, we also ﬁnd that theory has advanced suﬃciently to identify common reasons for why payment schemes fail or succeed. Moreover, payment schemes are often rolled out along with other policy instruments in so-called policy mixes. Advances in theory and evaluation research are needed to improve our understanding of how such policy mixes interact with the targeted social-ecological systems.},

The impact is estimated by means of panel data regressions and propensity score matching. Our results suggest that the payments are not contributing to the overall reforestation in Michoacán because of the existence of leakage in areas that are not participating in the program.

This research examines the role of motivations, external support, and barriers on farmer participation in reforestation in the tropics. Eighty-five household surveys and 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with farmers and organizations in Costa Rica. To measure motivations, we asked farmers’ their perceptions of environmental, social and financial outcomes of reforestation. External support was measured as perceived support from conservation organizations. Regression models were used to determine the significance of motivations and external support, controlling for household and biophysical characteristics, on reforestation behaviors. External support and environmental motivations both had a positive and statistically significant effect on reforestation. Farm size and the number of years spent on the property also positively influenced the decision to plant trees. Farmers identified instrumental pro-environmental values, such as water regulating ecosystem services, as their primary motivations for planting trees. Barriers to reforestation included a lack of technical skills for planting trees, unsuccessful past experiences, a lack of trust in external organizations and initial reforestation costs. Overall, this research indicates that environmental motivations influence the decision to participate in reforestation, but that external support is critical for overcoming initial participation barriers.},

In contrast to alternative DID estimators, the proposed estimators are consistent if either (but not necessarily both) a propensity score or outcome regression working models are correctly speciﬁed. We also derive the semiparametric eﬃciency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric eﬃciency bound when the working models are correctly speciﬁed. Furthermore, we quantify the potential eﬃciency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference. Simulation studies and an empirical application illustrate the desirable ﬁnite-sample performance of the proposed estimators. Open-source software for implementing the proposed policy evaluation tools is available.},

Most DD applications, however, exploit variation across groups of units that receive treatment at different times.

This defines the DD estimand and identifying assumption, a generalization of common trends. I discuss how to interpret DD estimates and propose a new balance test. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and provide a new analysis of models that include time-varying controls.},

This article examines the assumptions implicit in the argument that expanding replacement forests will help preserve native forest ecosystems, and considers their validity in Chile, one of the nations most advanced in the transition from old-growth to plantation forestry. Exotic plantation forestry in Chile surpassed native forestry in production volumes in the 1960s, and has captured markets formerly supplied by Chile’s native hardwoods. The economic pressure on the native forest, however, has been not relieved but exacerbated, because of the emergence of an international (mainly Japanese) market for low-value hardwood. In a world of plantations, native forests are valuable only during the lag between plantation establishment and maturation. Paradoxically, replacement forests may increase the vulnerability of native forests by relegating them to the role of a stopgap supply, alternating between overexploitation and abandonment.},

However, existing studies have not provided methodologically consistent analyses at sufﬁcient temporal and spatial scales to properly assess the state of Chile's forest transition. In the current study, we generate high-resolution maps of Chilean land use change between 1986, 2001 and 2011. We couple remote sensing with a review of historic assessments of Chile's forest resources to document long-term trends in forest extent. This historical review identiﬁes multiple discrete forest transitions throughout Chile's history. These ﬂuctuations in forest clearing emphasize that the cultural, economic and political forces that precipitate forest transitions can all be reversed. The remote sensing analysis calls into question ofﬁcial statistics indicating an expansion of native forests between 1986 and 2011. We ﬁnd that increases in forest cover were largely driven by the expansion of forest plantations, rather than through native forest regeneration. Plantation forests directly displaced native forests in many locations, especially during the 1986e2001 period. Nevertheless, declines in the rate of forest conversion during the 2001e2011 period suggest that plantations are beginning to ease pressure on native forests.},

We show that a family of causal eﬀect parameters are identiﬁed in staggered DiD setups, even if diﬀerences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identiﬁcation results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose diﬀerent aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment eﬀect heterogeneity across diﬀerent dimensions as well as to summarize the overall eﬀect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the eﬀect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

	abstract = {Designers and funders of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs have long worried that payments flow to landholders who would have conserved forests even without the program, undermining the environmental benefits (“additionality”) and cost-effectiveness of PES. If landholders self-select into PES programs based on how much conservation they were going to undertake anyway, then those who were planning to conserve should always enroll. This paper discusses the less-appreciated fact that enrollment is often based on other factors too. The hassle of signing up or financial costs of enrollment (e.g., purchasing seedlings) can affect who participates in a PES program. These enrollment costs reduce overall take-up, and, importantly, they can also influence the composition of landholders who select into the program—and thereby the program’s environmental benefits per enrollee. Enrollment costs can increase a program’s benefits per enrollee if they are systematically higher for (and thus deter enrollment by) landholders who would have conserved anyway. Alternatively, enrollment costs can dampen per-enrollee benefits if their correlation with status-quo conservation is in the opposite direction. We illustrate these points with evidence from two studies of randomized trials of PES programs aimed at increasing forest cover in Uganda and Malawi. We also discuss how in other sectors, such as social welfare, policy designers have purposefully adjusted the costs of program enrollment to influence the composition of participants and improve cost-effectiveness. We propose that these ideas for targeting could be incorporated into the design of PES programs.},

Thus, carbon payments would induce conservation and also carbon sequestration, and if land users were poor could conserve forest while addressing rural poverty. We note that the poor appear to be marginalized in the sense of living where land proﬁtability is lower. Those areas also have more forest. We ﬁnd that poorer areas may have a higher supply response to payments, but even without this effect poor areas might be included and beneﬁt more due to higher (per capita) forest area. They might be included less due to transactions costs, though.

	abstract = {The temperate forests of Chile are classiﬁed a biological ‘‘hotspot’’ as a result of their high species diversity and high endemism. However, they are being rapidly destroyed, with signiﬁcant negative impacts on biodiversity. Three land-cover maps were derived from satellite imagery acquired over 25 years (1975, 1990 and 2000), and were used to assess the patterns of deforestation and forest fragmentation in the coastal range of south-central Chile. Between 1975 and 2000, there was a reduction in natural forest area of 67\% in the study area, which is equivalent to an annual forest loss rate of 4.5\% per year using a compound-interest-rate formula. Forest fragmentation was associated with a decrease in forest patch size, which was associated with a rapid increase in the density of small patches ({\textless}100 ha), and a decrease in area of interior forest and in connectivity among patches. Since the 1970s, native forest loss was largely caused by an expansion of commercial plantations, which was associated with substantial changes in the spatial conﬁguration of the native forests. By 2000, most native forest fragments were surrounded by highly connected exotic-species plantations. The assessment of forest loss and fragmentation provides a basis for future research on the impacts of forest fragmentation on the different component of biodiversity. Conservation strategies and land use planning of the study area should consider the spatial conﬁguration pattern of native forest fragments and how this pattern changes over time and space at landscape level.},

Sellers of offsets have private information about their opportunity costs, leading to concerns about whether offsets are additional. Non-additional offsets can undermine a cap-and-trade program or, if the government purchases them directly, result in enormous government expenditures. We analyze contracts for carbon sequestration in forests that mitigate the asymmetric information problem. Landowners are offered a menu of two-part contracts that induces them to reveal their type. Under this scheme, the government is able to identify ex post how much additional forest each landowner contributes and minimize ex ante its expenditures on carbon sequestration. To explore the performance of the contracting scheme, we conduct a national-scale simulation using an econometric model of land-use change. The results indicate that for an increase in forest area of 61 million acres, government expenditures are \$5.3 billion lower under the contracting approach compared to a uniform subsidy offered to all landowners. This compares to an increase in private opportunity costs of just \$110 million dollars under the contracts. Thus, the contracting scheme is preferable from society's perspective.},

We show that they estimate weighted sums of the average treatment effects (ATE ) in each group and period, with weights that may be negative. Due to the negative weights, the linear regression coefficient may for instance be negative while all the ATEs are positive. We propose another estimator that solves this issue. In the two applications we revisit, it is significantly different from the linear regression estimator. (JEL C21, C23, D72, J31, J51, L82)},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our proposed tools by analyzing the effect of the minimum wage on teen employment from 2001–2007.

In practice, however, different DID procedures rely on different parallel trends assumptions (PTAs), and recover different causal parameters. In this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event studies) and discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identiﬁcation and estimation of causal parameters. We document a “robustness” versus “efﬁciency” trade-off in terms of the strength of the underlying PTA and argue that practitioners should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We propose new DID estimators that reﬂect these trade-offs and derive their large sample properties. We illustrate the practical relevance of these results by assessing whether the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act affects compliance rates.},

Based on Weberian philosophy of science, it is argued that an ideal PES type, strongly embedded in PES theory, is needed to understand their logic. Many broader, empiricist deﬁnitions fail to distinguish PES from the larger generic family of positive environmental incentives, thus eroding their meaning by excessive vagueness. Arguably, PES deﬁnitions should focus on describing a functional tool, rather than normatively integrating desirable PES outcomes. A modiﬁed narrow PES deﬁnition is proposed, outlining conditionality as the single deﬁning feature, avoiding the buyer-seller terms, and linking PES to offsite externalities. Extensive explanatory guidelines address many valid conceptual concerns raised in the recent PES literature.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Livestock supply chains account for 14.5\% of global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. There is a consensus that approaches that improve cattle productivity while enhancing carbon sequestration can contribute to the multiple goals of improving ranchers’ livelihoods and mitigating climate change. Identifying policies that simultaneously increase productivity and sequestration is therefore critical to promote sustainable growth in the livestock sector. This paper documents the impact of training and technical assistance on pasture restoration and productivity in Brazil. We found that providing technical assistance to previously trained producers promoted pasture restoration, induced farmers to use more inputs, helped them improve their practices, and increased productivity and carbon sequestration. These findings highlight the importance of providing customized information to ranchers to help them sustainably intensify.
          , 
            Innovation and improved practices in the livestock sector represent key opportunities to meet global climate goals. This paper provides evidence that extension services can promote pasture restoration in cattle ranching in Brazil. We use a randomized controlled trial implemented in the context of the ABC Cerrado (a large-scale program launched in 2014 aimed at fostering technology adoption through a combination of training and technical assistance) to examine the effects of different types of extension on agricultural practices, input use, and productivity. Providing technical assistance to previously trained producers promoted pasture restoration, induced farmers to use inputs more intensively, helped them to improve their management and soil conservation practices, and substantially increased revenues. A cost–benefit calculation indicates that US\$1 invested in the ABC Cerrado program increased profits by US\$1.08 to \$1.45. Incorporating carbon savings amplifies this return considerably.},
