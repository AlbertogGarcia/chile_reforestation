# Abstract {-}


# Introduction

In order to achieve the warming targets set by the IPCC, both emissions reductions and removals of carbon from the atmosphere will be necessary [ref-XX]. Reforestation has been lauded as a potentially near term, large scale and low-cost option to achieve carbon removals [@busch2019, @bastin2020], however, there is limited evidence documenting the effectiveness of policies seeking to encourage reforestation at large scales. One policy that is expected to play an important role in helping countries meet their reforestation commitments is a system in which private landowners are paid to engage in reforestation [@gichuki]. While similar payment for ecosystem services programs have garnered widespread scientific interest [@boerner], empirical studies documenting the impacts of reforestation programs are critical to guide the effective design of policies as more countries adopt this model. 

Problem paragraph- discuss PES concerns and social safeguards

In this paper, we evaluate the land cover impacts of Chile’s Native Forest Law. A key concern with evaluations of PES is that apparent effectiveness may be driven by unobservable differences in participation costs, meaning that performance may be attributed to these omitted characteristics rather than participation in the program [@Alix-Garcia-2015]. From a pool of over one million untreated properties, we construct a set of counterfactual properties based on landowner and property characteristics in order to alleviate concerns surrounding selection. We evaluate land cover impacts for eleven cohorts (2009–2019) using annual data from 2005–2020 and regressions that are robust to general treatment effect heterogeneity. 

We then analyze the Native Forest Law’s program design to understand whether improved environmental impacts could have been achieved without sacrificing social development goals such as the involvement of smallholders and indigenous peoples. 

These results make three main contributions to the literature. We advance the literature that addresses whether reforestation may be a viable large-scale method for removing and storing CO2  and add to the limited existing evidence on the environmental effectiveness of large-scale reforestation programs. Few other studies address the ex-post carbon impacts of large-scale reforestation or afforestation policies. Between 2009 and 2019, the National Forest Corporation (CONAF) allocated approximately US $58 million to enroll more than 235 hectares of land in the program, making it one of the largest native forest reforestation programs in the world. As other countries begin to contemplate reforestation policies, Chile’s experience provides a valuable case study from which to draw. 

Our second contribution is to investigate whether heterogeneity in program impacts implies tradeoffs between environmental efficacy and achievement of social safeguards. In our paper, we show that larger landowners see clear and sustained gains in forest cover relative to comparable unawarded properties. On the other hand, smallholders see no positive or statistically significant impacts on vegetation. This demonstrates the challenges of meeting both environmental and social development goals with a single policy instrument. 

Lastly, this paper contributes to the literature on targeting in PES programs. Alix-Garcia et al. (2015) find that, in theory, Mexico's ... program could not have achieved improved environmental impact without sacrificing poverty alleviation. Chile's Native Forest Law allocates funding based on a score that judges assign the project according to a pre-determined set of criteria. We are thus able to examine whether the scores predicted program impact in practice, revealing the effectiveness of the law's targeting approach. 

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides program background on Chile’s Native Forest Law. and our data sources.  Section 3 presents our data sources and program evaluation methods. Section 4 presents our impact evaluation results. Section 5 analyzes the program’s targeting mechanism as it pertains to environmental performance and social development goals. Section 6 concludes. 

# Chile as a case study

Chile’s extreme latitudinal and climatic gradient have yielded dramatic variation in its forest types – varying from open canopy, sclerophyllous forests near Santiago to the temperate rainforests of Northern Patagonia which are some of the most carbon-dense forests in the world [44, 45]. Chile has also experienced diverse and widespread tree cover expansion [46]. Such tree cover expansion includes extensive afforestation of pine and eucalyptus plantations [47, 48], natural forest regeneration in the wake of disturbance [49, 50], and active native reforestation and restoration [51]. 

Second, Chile’s long history of public policies supporting tree cover expansion provides an incredibly useful natural experiment in which to measure the impacts of payments for reforestation. DL701 longest operating laws, but promoted even-aged mococulture plantations of eucalyptus and pine. In an attempt to encourage more reforestation of native forests, Chile passed the Ley de Recuperación del Bosque Nativo y Fomento Forestal (Native Forest Law) in 2008. In addition to protections for native forests, the law established an annual competition for grants to support private landowners in their efforts to restore or reforest their land using native species. Since 2009, more than $58 million have been allocated through these competitions to reforest 235 thousand hectares, with a particular emphasis placed upon supporting smallholders and indigenous peoples. Landowners are able to claim larger subsidies for species that are endangered and in regions or ecosystems in more urgent need of native forest restoration.

# A check in with the reader

A major point of tension in this paper is the lens through which it should be viewed as I move forward. I think this stems from the fact that there is a lot going on here, so I need to narrow in. I see two main paths forward: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{the difficulty of targeting for multiple program objectives: environmental effectiveness and meeting social development goals:} the program sought to balance efficiency and equity outcomes by targeting smallholders and indigenous communities. If those payments were non-additional, the program could be viwed almost as a cash transfer. In that case, it would be interesting to learn about the foregone environmental benefits from the targeting scheme. This path relies on obtaining convincing treatment effect estimates. 

\item \textbf{optimal program design:} Reforestation may provide an interesting lens through which to explore optimal program design, and this setting has several interesting design components. 
\end{enumerate}

I discuss possible pathways to move forward with option \#2 in this section. In the next section, I move forward along the lines of option \#1 and present the initial program evaluation.
